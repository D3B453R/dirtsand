To generate keys for DirtSand, use the follwing process:

1) Generate two 512-bit random primes (N and K) for each server
     $ openssl rand -base64 64
2) Copy these keys into your DirtSand config file:
     Key.Auth.N = <key>
     Key.Auth.K = <key>
     ...and so on for Key.Gate and Key.Game...
3) Run dirtsand to generate the public keys (X):
     keygen auth
     keygen gate
     keygen game
4) Copy N and X as provided by dirtsand into the client binaries
